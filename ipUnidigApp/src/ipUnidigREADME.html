<h1 align="center">ipUnidig</h1>

<h2 align="center">Author: Mark Rivers</h2>

<p>This package provides support for the Greenspring IP-Unidig
series of digital I/O IP modules. It also supports the Systran
DIO316I module. The IP-Unidig family includes more than 20
separate models. This software provides support for most of these
models. Most models provide 24 bits, with each bit individually
programmable as an input or an output. The last section of this
document describes any special features or restrictions on
particular models.</p>

<P>
The software is available as a
<A HREF="ftp://cars.uchicago.edu/pub/epics/ipUnidigApp.tar">tar file</A>.

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>For output device support sends Int32Messages with the
following info:</p>

<p>address - &quot;mask&quot;, a bit pattern of bits to be set or
cleared</p>

<p>value - DAC value when cmd=cmdSetDAC. Otherwise not used</p>

<p>cmd - cmdSetBits, cmdClearBits, or cmdSetDAC</p>

<p>cmdSetBits: All bits which are 1 in the mask will be set to 1
in the output register. Bits which are 0 in the mask will be
unaffected in the output register.</p>

<p>cmdClearBits: All bits which are 1 in the mask will be set to
0 in the output register. Bits which are 0 in the mask will be
unaffected in the output register.</p>

<p>cmdSetDAC: This command is used to set the digital-to-analog
converter (DAC) in the IP-Unidig-HV series of modules. This DAC
is used to set the input threshold on a comparator. The value is
12 bits, in 15 mV units, for a range of 0-61 volts. </p>

<p>The output server returns an Int32Message with status=(0,-1)
for (success, failure). </p>

<hr>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>For input device support sends Int32Messages with the
following info:</p>

<p>address - not used</p>

<p>value - not used </p>

<p>cmd - cmdStartMonitor or cmdStopMonitor</p>

<p>The input server polls the input register at 10Hz. Whenever it
detects that any input bit has changed it sends a reply message
to the last client which sent it a cmdStartMonitor command. This
reply message is an Int32Messages which contains the current
value of all input bits. If the server receives a cmdStopMonitor
command it stops sending reply messages until it receives another
cmdStartMonitor command. </p>

<p>The reply messages sent by the server to the client on change
of any input bit are Int32Messages containing the following
information:</p>

<p>address - not used</p>

<p>value - The current value of the input register</p>

<hr>

<h3>Server configuration</h3>

<p>initIpUnidig(&quot;moduleName&quot;,&quot;carrier&quot;,&quot;site&quot;,queueSize)</p>

<p>where </p>

<p>moduleName - The &quot;base&quot; server name (see note below)
</p>

<p>carrier - The ip carrier name</p>

<p>site - carrier IP site </p>

<p>queueSize - message queue size. Make this the maximum number
of records attached to this device. </p>

<p>initIpUnidig starts two separate server tasks, one for output
and one for input. The names of these servers are
&quot;moduleName&quot;Out and &quot;moduleName&quot;In
respectively. The reason for having separate input and output
servers is that the input server polls the read register at 10Hz,
with a taskDelay(sysClkRateGet()/10) between polls. If the same
server were used for output it would introduce a 0.1 second
latency in responding to output commands, which is not
desireable.</p>

<h2 align="center">EPICS Device Support</h2>

<p>EPICS device support is currently provided for 3 records,
binary output (bo), long input (longin) and binary input (bi). </p>

<p>The bo record format is: </p>

<p>field(DTYP,&quot;Greenspring IP-Unidig&quot;) </p>

<p>field(INP,&quot;#C{card} S{signal} @{serverName}) </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>card = The location of the server </p>
    <p>signal = The output bit, starting with 0. Most models have
    24 bits, so signal is typically in the range 0-23. </p>
    <p>serverName = Must be &quot;moduleName&quot;Out, where
    &quot;moduleName&quot; was specified with initIpUnidig </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For input the device support is done as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A single longin record is attached to each server. This
        longin record receives the asynchronous reply messages
        from the server whenever any input bit changes state. The
        longin record thus contains current state of all of the
        input bits.</li>
    <li>Multiple binary input (bi) records are attached to the
        longin record. These bi records are normally set to use
        &quot;I/O Intr&quot; scanning, and they will all be
        processed whenever the associated longin record is
        notified that any input bit has changed state. These bi
        records obtain their values directly from the longin
        record, so there is no MPF message traffic generated when
        these records process. </li>
</ul>

<p>The longin record should be configured as follows:</p>

<p>field(DTYP,&quot;Greenspring IP-Unidig&quot;) </p>

<p>field(INP,&quot;#C{card} S{signal} @{serverName})</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>card = The location of the server</p>
    <p>signal = Not used </p>
    <p>serverName = Must be &quot;moduleName&quot;In, where
    &quot;moduleName&quot; was specified with initIpUnidig </p>
</blockquote>

<p>field(SCAN,&quot;Passive&quot;) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bi records should be configured as follows:</p>

<p>field(DTYP,&quot;Greenspring IP-Unidig&quot;)</p>

<p>field(INP,&quot;#C{card} S{signal} @{recordName})</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>card = Not used</p>
    <p>signal = The input bit, starting with 0. Most models have
    24 bits, so signal is in the range 0-23. </p>
    <p>recordname = The name of the longin record described above
    Note that there is currently no device support for the
    cmdSetDAC command with the IP-Unidig-HV modules. It is easy
    to add ao record support for this. </p>

<h2 align="center">IP-Unidig Models</h2>

<p>The IP-Unidig family consists of more than 20 different
models. These models differ in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The input and output drivers can be TTL (IP-Unidig),
        differential (IP-Unidig-D), optically isolated
        (IP-Unidig-O), high-voltage (IP-Unidig-HV), or LineSafe
        (IP-Unidig-E).</li>
    <li>On some models the inputs are capabable of generating
        interrupts. Models which can generate interrupts have a
        &quot;-I&quot; in the model name, e.g. IP-Unidig-I and
        IP-Unidig-I-HV. The interrupt capability of the modules
        is <em>not used</em> in the this software. The reason is
        that the modules can be programmed to generate an
        interrupt on the rising edge or the falling edge of the
        input signal, <em>but not both</em>. Thus, the hardware
        interrupts cannot be used to detect an arbitrary
        &quot;change-of-state&quot;. Instead, the inputs on all
        models are polled at 10 Hz, and
        &quot;pseudo-interrupts&quot; are generated by the input
        server if any input changes state. Users who are
        considering buying IP-Unidig modules for use with this
        software can save a little money by not purchasing the
        interrupt capable models. Users who need the faster
        response which the interrupt driven models can provide
        will have to modify this software.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following provides information on specific models. Note
that only the IP-Unidig-I and Systran DIO316I have actually been
tested. The support for other models is based on reading the
manuals. Users who have problems are encouraged to contact the
author so that fixes can be incorporated. </p>

<dl>
    <dt>IP-Unidig, IP-Unidig-I</dt>
    <dd>The basic model (IP-Unidig) provides 24 bits of parallel
        I/O. Each bit can either be an input or an output. The
        outputs are open-collector. Writing a 1 to a bit turns
        off the open collector driver. In this state the on-board
        1k pullup resistors will pull the line up to +5V, and an
        external device can pull the line low. Thus, writing a 1
        to a bit allows that bit to be an input. At power-up all
        bits are set to 1, allowing them to be inputs. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt>IP-Unidig-E, IP-Unidig-I-E</dt>
    <dd>This is identical to the IP-Unidig except that the inputs
        have LineSafe protection. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt>IP-Unidig-E48</dt>
    <dd>This is identical to the IP-Unidig except that the inputs
        have LineSafe protection and there are 48 lines, rather
        than 24. This software currently only supports the first
        24 bits when used with the IP-Unidig-E48. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt>IP-Unidig-D, IP-Unidig-I-D</dt>
    <dd>This is identical to the IP-Unidig except that the inputs
        and outputs use differential line drivers. The outputs
        are not open collector, and hence if a line is used as an
        output it cannot be used as an input. This software
        enables the output drivers dynamically. If a bit is set
        or cleared then that line is assumed to be an output, and
        its output driver is turned on. Once it is turned on it
        is never turned off. At powerup all output drivers are
        turned off, so all lines can be inputs. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt>IP-Unidig-HV, IP-Unidig-I-HV </dt>
    <dd>This is similar to the IP-Unidig except that the inputs
        and outputs are high-voltage capable. There are 2
        options, -16I8O (16 inputs and 8 outputs) and -8I160 (8
        inputs, 16 outputs). Each high-voltage input is converted
        to a digital signal by the use of a voltage comparator.
        The reference for this comparator is an on-board 12 bit
        D/A converter, with a resolution of 15 mV/bit. At
        initialization the D/A is programmed for 2.5 volts.
        Device support can send messages with cmd = cmdSetDAC,
        and value=DAC value in the range 0 to 4095, corresponding
        to 0V to 61V threshold. On the 16I8O model the inputs are
        bits 0-15, and the outputs are bits 16-23. On the 8I16O
        model the inputs are bits 0-7, and the outputs are bits
        8-23. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt>IP-Unidig-O, IP-Unidig-I-O </dt>
    <dd>This is similar to the IP-Unidig except that the inputs
        and outputs are optically isolated. There are 3 options,
        -24IO (24 inputs/outputs), 12I12O (12 inputs, 12
        outputs), -24I (24 inputs). On models with outputs the
        outputs are all enabled in the initialization code. On
        the 24IO model each line can be individually set to be an
        input by setting the output value to 1, just as with the
        basic IP-Unidig model. On the 12I12O model the inputs are
        bits 0-11 and the outputs are bits 12-23. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt>Other IP-Unidig models</dt>
    <dd>The IP-Unidig-T, IP-Unidig-T-D, IP-Unidig-P and
        IP-Unidig-P-D are not currently supported because they
        are quite different from the other IP-Unidig models </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt>Systran DIO316I </dt>
    <dd>This is a digital I/O module which is similar to the
        IP-Unidig. This software support sets the module up as
        follows: - Ports 0-3 are output ports. This provides 32
        bits of output. However, device support currently only
        supports the first 24 bits (ports 0-2). - All output
        ports are enabled. - Ports 4 and 5 are input ports. This
        provides 16 bits of input, bits 0-15. </dd>
